# Code and projects for Harper

A simple game where you control a robot jumping and collecting stars.
- Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the robot
- Press SPACEBAR to jump
- Collect stars to increase your score
- The robot glows purple just like in your artwork!

Try to collect as many stars as you can! Every time you collect a star, a new one will appear somewhere else on the screen.
